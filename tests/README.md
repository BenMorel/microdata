## Tests for Microdata

The [index of tests](https://w3c.github.io/microdata/tests/) describes the expected results for these tests,
along with about 40 tests from the [Microdata to RDF test suite](http://w3c.github.io/microdata-rdf/tests/).

## To Do:

* Check that everything in the spec is tested
* Check that the expected test results are what the spec says
* Run the tests and record the results properly
* Make an implementation report with that Information
